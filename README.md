Functional programming is a programming paradigm a way of thinking about, and structuring your code. It’s an alternative to procedural or object-oriented programming.

#### Joe Armstrong: 
The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

#### Functions as Units of Behavior
- Identifying an abstraction and building a function for it.
- Using existing functions to build more complex abstractions.
- Passing existing functions to other functions to build even more complex abstractions.
